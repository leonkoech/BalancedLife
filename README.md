## **Is your life balanced?**

Everyday, people deal with many aspects of their life that cause them stress. Work, Finances, Relationships, Health, etc. All of these facets are important and yet it is so hard to prioritize everything.

## 🛠 What We Do 🛠

We allow users to rank different aspects of their lives on a scale of 0-10. From a selection of 10 categories, users can reflect on what those rankings are and what they want them to be. We recommend users with actions to take in order to improve categories ranking 5 and under, and users can add their own personal tasks that they wish to work on for the week.
